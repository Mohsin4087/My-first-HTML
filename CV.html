     <!-- Intro -->
      <h4> Intro </h4>
    <p> I am a keen hardworking person, who is driven to create a better future. I have
      graduated from Kingston University with a Beng in Civil engineering and Built Environments and have worked
      for a global leading engineering firm , <strong>Atkins Realis</strong> as an apprentice 
      for six years. I hold amazing experiences on major projects such as HS2 C1 , M25 network and Heathrow. I aspire to 
      work for inovative projects such as Neom in KSA to help support sustainable engineering. </p>
      
     <p>
      I am a father to an amazing daughter, so family is a key part of my life. I am eager to provide a better tomorrow for 
      the people to come after me. Outside off engineering I enjoy sports, food , travelling and learning new skills. Currently I have enrolled
      with a prestigous school the <em> semicolon.School</em> that is mentoring me to gain the skills in becoming a Full stack software engineer. Once I 
      graduate from the school I will focus on creating small projects and hopefully try and generate a side income from these smaller project.
      These characteristic are evident that I am always trying to broaden my experiences and constantly learning.
